# wikidata-entity-store

This library basically is a hardcoded cache for a specific kind of object.
If you want to store wikidata entities use a generic cache.
This will always be better suited for your usecase and better tested.

[Keyv](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv) for example can get this job done.
